Missing pieces:
* add all needed jobs: http://springrts.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?p=485903#p485903
* Possibility to put a job "on hold" and schedule it to try (n times) again
  later without blocking a thread.
	-> make a job, that sleeps for an amout of time + restarts
* make more defined states for a job (for example: 0=new, 1=running, 3=retry, 4=schedule, ...)
* reload job in python if code changed: http://pyunit.sourceforge.net/notes/reloading.html
* unload job when none is running (to save memory)
* reread ini-file on signal (USR1 or something)
* add posibility to overwrite default job-settings with parameter
* make parser more stable
