Missing pieces:
* Possibility to put a job "on hold" and schedule it to try (n times) again
  later without blocking a thread.
* No useful job was written as I don't have access to springfiles.com I don't
  even know the correct paths - just an example and some "templates/job ideas".
* bugs :)
* reread ini-file on signal (USR1 or something)
* atm notifications are configured for a class of jobs, but maybe it would be
  better to set it up per-job when connecting to the socket
* I'm not aware of most things that go on @sf.com, so probably a lot of
  features are missing :)
* make upq.cfg system wide accessible through a singleton, automatically
  link UpqJobs.jobcfg and UpqTasks.config with their respective info
* feel free to add here or use https://github.com/springfiles/upq/issues
